        In this test, you will evaluate the quality of different models.
        You will listen to a reference DI signal (the undistorted version) and the output of 4 models.

        Your task is to compare each test sample to the clean reference and rate its quality on a scale from 0 to 100, where:
        100 means the sample sounds identical to the clean reference (best quality).
        0 means the sample sounds very different from the clean reference (worst quality).
        You are allowed to give multiple sample sounds the same score.

        You will be presented 5 conditions, the output of 4 models + the reference DI (hidden among the conditions).

        If you would like to listen to the distorted input audio, they are here: https://e.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=kZ7oAlZFhtA6pJBhhySkQmM5Eua9JjkbeOV
